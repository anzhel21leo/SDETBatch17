Type Casting:
    Type casting is converting data from one datatype to another datatype.
    For example we can convert an integer to float or other way around
    There are two types of type casting. Type casting only works with primitive
    data types.
    1) Implicit/Auto/widening
    2) Explicit/Manual/narrowing
Example
    int number=(float)10.5
====================================================
if statements
   if statements are part of conditional constructs in java. They help us
   write code that be executed based on a condition.
   There are many variation of if statements 1)if 2) if-else 3) else-if
   4) Nested if
Why we need conditional statements?
   Whithout the if statements programs will always generate same output
   not matter what.
Syntax:
   if(Condition){
   something that we want to execute if condition is true
