Operators:
    Operators are symbols which perform operation on data.
    There are many diffrent types of operators in java.
Arithmetic Operators:
    These operators help us perform simple mathematical operations like:
    Addition       => +  int a=10, b=20, c=a+b; => 30
    Subtraction    => -
    Multiplication => *
    Division       => /
    Modulas        => %
Shorthand Operators:
    They help us perform Mathematical operators but using a little shorter syntax.
    add and update the variable      += int a=10 a+=20 => 30
    subtract and update the variable -= int a=10 a-=20 => -10
    multiple and update the variable *= int a=10 a*=20 => 200
    divide and update the variable   /= int a=10 a/=20 => 0
Relational Operator:
    These operators help us compare things.
    == checks if two objects are equal
    != checks if two objects are NOT equal
    >  checks if two objects are greater than
    <  checks if two objects are less than
    >= checks if two objects are greater than equal
    <= checks if two objects are greater than equal
Logical Operators:
    They help us combine multiple boolean conditions.
    ! NOT
    || OR
    && AND
Increment/Decrement Operators:
    ++ this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
    -- this will help us decrease the value of the variable by one
Note:
While loop checks the condition first then executes the code.
Do while on the other hand executes the code first and then the condistion.
Sometimes when we write the logic using do while it becomes easier. There
are no other difference and reasons to use a do while instead of while.
