Object Oriented programing:
    Its just a way (Set of rules) of writing code
    It basically helps us write large amounts of code.
    That is easier to change and manage. There are other ways like
    functional programing and procedural programing.
Why we should use OOP?
    1) It helps us write large amounts of code easily.
    2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easier.
    3) Changing code becomes easier.
    4) Sharing code and calibration becomes easier.
Main concepts:
    1) Classes and Objects.
    2) Inheritance.
    3) Polymorphism.
    4) Abstraction.
    5) Encapsulation.
Classes and Objects:
    A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we
    start building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes
    which help us figure out how something works like and they have
    behaviours/functions which help us understand how something works.
