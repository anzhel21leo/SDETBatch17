Logical Operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions on the same line in "if" statements
    There are three types of logical operators
    -NOT (!)
    -OR(||)
    -AND (&&)
    true=>false
    false=>true
Why should we use NOT operator:
    1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
    2) Code readability will increase.
OR (||):
    Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions
    is such a way that as soon as one condistion gets true the whole condition will be
    elevated to true
true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false
true||true||true=>true

AND (&&)
    Logical and operator will help us combne the conditions in such a way
    that it will only give us true if all the conditions are true.
true&&false&&true=>false
false&&false&&false=>false
true&&true&&true=>true
